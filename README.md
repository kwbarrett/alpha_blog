# Alpha Blog

This is the repository for the first alpha-blog app of the **Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course**,
which can be found at [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/). It's completely experimental and for the sole purpose of my learning Ruby on Rails. The production application is deployed to Heroku at [https://alpha-blog-kwbarrett.herokuapp.com/](https://alpha-blog-kwbarrett.herokuapp.com/).
